    <h2>📖 My Journey</h2>
    <p>From coding my first Python script to building a smart power monitoring system with GDG, every step has been a learning experience. I’ve dived into backend frameworks like Node.js and Express, explored computer vision with OpenCV, and pitched ideas that matter.</p>
    <p>Whether it's a hackathon or a late-night bug fix, I thrive on challenges and collaboration. My goal? To create tech that makes life better — smarter homes, greener cities, and AI that understands us.</p>
